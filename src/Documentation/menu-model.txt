menu_model
  definition:
  data_type:object
  menu_items (many)
    definition: Provides inputs to a component. Individual keys store values that may change based on the user experience.  For example, clicking on a tab in a menu would invoke a component with a given object_type.  As the same component can be used for different tabs/different object types, object_type is a key at the menu level. 
    data_type: Object
    menu_item_key(many):
        label: The pretty name to show when references
        object_type (inherited):
        menu_component: Name of the component to use for the menu
        id (inherited):
        api_objects (inherited unless overridden): parameters that will ultimately get passed to the api for data retrieval
        others_props (many,not inherited):  other menu keys will be passed to the first layer of the component (but not to the list/row/field framework - see component_model)
        component_model - specification for the list / row / field level of the component. (See component model)
        target_menu_name: When a component contains more than 1 component (drill down), target_menu_name will specify the menu for the target component (enhancement - allow more than 2 components)  TODO - change name to remove (name)
  menu_key (many) 
    definition: List of menu_items keys   
    data_type: array of menu_item_keys
    notes: Application will use the app_menu and hamburger menu for the main page top tabs and hamburger. (later enhancement might be to have this driven by application parameters).  The concep is that menus can be used in other parts of the application (panels) but this has not been tested yet
    menu_items_names: array of menu_item_names
