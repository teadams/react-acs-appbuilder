Component Models: Object containing all the component_models
  definition: Specifies the list/row/field properties
  data type: object
  precedence:
    component_model prop
    component_model as provided by the component_model_name prop
    default_component_model for the component
    Overrides are applied per property. So a higher level only has to provide the property that will be overridden
  component_key (many):
    list, field, row: Object that contains the component_model input to use at that level
    names: (object)
      purpose(many): name of component to use for a given purposes. Individual kwys depend on the list/field/row/level
        list -
        field -
        row
    components: actual component, which will override name. (used internally not in the JSON model)
        purpose(many) - parallels component name
    props: a set of input props to use at this level. 
        (input props to the component will override depending on the level)
    default_mode: view, click_to_edit, edit, text  
        mode prop will override
        Higher layer may impact the ones below
            Edit/text bubbles down and overrides the layers below. 
            click_to_edit forces a view/edit on the ones below depending
